Too Many Wrappers
===

Allows the definition of three custom "wrappers," prefixes and suffixes that will surround selected text. They're triggered, respectively, by clicking with the Option key, Command key or no modifier key held down. 

Think of it as a custom version of the comments plugin. 

When installing the extension, the options will appear. They can be accessed again by going into edit mode in the plugins dropdown and clicking the gear icon next to "Wrappers."
