Brett's PopClip Extensions
=================

My (hopefully) growing collection of [PopClip][1] extensions.

### Installation

For the time being, I'm just including these as source, not `.popclipextz` packages. To install, just make sure the extension of a folder is `.popclipext` and double click it in Finder.

### Markdownify ###

This extension converts selected HTML text to Markdown using html2text by Aaron Swartz. Reference-style links are used and the references are placed after the text. Wrapping is disabled.

The extension shows up in PopClip as "2MD".

### OpenURLS

This extension searches selected text for urls (http or custom handlers) and opens all urls in their default applications.

The default OpenInChrome extension is Chrome-specific and only works with a single URL. This extension allows as many urls as you can select and will open whatever browser your system has assigned to the handler. This includes nvalt:// and txmt:// links, as well as http:// links. If you use something like [Choosy][2] it will open them through that.
