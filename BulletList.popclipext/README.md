BulletList
===

PopClip extension to turn lines of text into Markdown bullet items. Indentation is handled as nested lists and existing markers are overwritten (numbered list becomes bullet list).

Holding option while clicking the button for the extension in the PopClip bar will create/update a numbered list instead.
